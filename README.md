# UIUC-Course-Availability-Checker
Checks availability of a course at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign ~every 30 seconds(randomized).  Reports availability every hour or if there is a change in the availability. This was made because UIUCs own tracker only updates every 10 mins and always misses the course openings
